# Irish-Election-Results-Comparison-
The Irish voting system uses a form of proportional representation called the single transferable vote.  Irish voters indicate their preferences for candidates in ascending order of preference; 1 for the most preferred candidate, 2 for the next preferred candidate and so on. The first preference votes are the ones counted in the first count of the vote counting process.  The counts indicated by the first count give the number of first preference votes that a candidate has received. This assignment uses first preferences votes to compare the performance between the 2016 and 2020 elections.
